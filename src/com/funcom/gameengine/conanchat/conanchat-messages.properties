#
# Contains all messages concerning Conan chat.
#
# Each key corresponds to a package, while the value of the key
# is a comma separated list of message classes.
#
# NOTE
# If you check the list, you will notice that GroupJoin is missing,
# and only GroupJoinServer is there. That is intentional move, explained here:
# Python server has two different messages, that are named same and have same
# ID. Both of those messages are called GroupMessage, and one is sent from client to server,
# the other vice versa.
# Since this list is used by message factory, and since factory should only be used
# to create INCOMING messages, GroupMessage message will never be constructed from buffer;
# GroupMessageServer, however, will be.
# GroupMessage message we will construct manually, as normal, and send around.
